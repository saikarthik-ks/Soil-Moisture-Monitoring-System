# Soil-Moisture-Monitoring-System

The Soil Moisture Monitoring and Automatic Irrigation System is a project designed to automate the watering of plants based on real-time soil moisture readings. It continuously monitors the water content in the soil and activates a water pump whenever the soil becomes too dry, ensuring optimal moisture levels for plant health while conserving water. The system uses a soil moisture sensor and a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, to detect the soil's moisture content and control a relay-operated pump.

This system helps eliminate the need for manual watering and prevents both overwatering and underwatering. The moisture levels are read by the sensor, and when the soil becomes dry below a defined threshold, the pump turns on automatically to supply water. Once the moisture content rises above a set value, the pump stops automatically. The readings, including raw sensor values, moisture percentages, and pump status, are displayed on the Serial Monitor for easy observation. The system also includes timing controls to prevent the pump from turning on or off too frequently, ensuring stable and efficient operation.

The main objective of this project is to monitor and analyze soil moisture levels in real time for efficient irrigation and improved crop management. It uses basic electronic components such as an Arduino Uno or Nano, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a relay module, a DC water pump, jumper wires, and a power supply. The soil sensor’s analog output is connected to the Arduino’s A0 pin, while the relay is connected to digital pin 8, which controls the pump based on the moisture readings.

In operation, the system continuously reads soil moisture every second and converts the analog sensor data into a percentage value. If the moisture level falls below 35%, the pump is turned on, and watering begins. When the soil moisture exceeds 55%, the pump turns off, ensuring that the soil maintains the required moisture balance. Calibration of the sensor is done by recording the raw analog readings for both completely dry and fully wet soil and updating these values in the program.

This project offers several advantages such as reduced manual labor, water conservation, and enhanced crop growth through precise irrigation control. It is energy-efficient and can be powered by an adapter, USB, or even a solar setup for field applications. The system can also be upgraded to include temperature and humidity monitoring, IoT connectivity for remote control, or mobile alerts for advanced automation.

Overall, the soil moisture monitoring system provides an effective, low-cost, and scalable solution for smart irrigation. It ensures consistent soil hydration, prevents water wastage, and contributes to sustainable agriculture practices.
